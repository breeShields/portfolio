            <h3>Brief</h3>
            <p>I was required to develop a label for a new craft beer (Wild Betty) for fictitious brand, Billy’s Brew. The client gave complete creative freedom provided the design was unique and resonated with the coastal lifestyle of Noosa, Queensland, where the brand was established. 
            The label was to fit on a single serve bottle up to 330ml in size and a die cut and one embellishment were requested to help the product stand out. The design needed to include mandatory product information such as: the Billy’s Brew logo, the name of the brew, a short description of the product, a barcode, the standard drinks logo, ingredients, volume, a recycling logo, and space for a use-by date to be printed. The artwork for the labels then had to be set up correctly for print. </p>

            <h3>My Contribution</h3>
            <p>When thinking of ‘Wild Betty’ as a concept, I pictured something fun, exciting, and possibly humorous for the label design. I was originally going to use the image of a human as ‘Betty’ but thought it may be a bit more ‘fun’ to incorporate a native animal. That is where the idea of the dolphin wearing the sun hat came in. The flowers in the hat are Melaleucas which are native to the Noosa area and the colour scheme was developed by colour picking from photographs of the area that I had chosen for my mood board.</p> <br>
            <p>The main label is a full wrap around label that is rectangular with a wavy die cut on the top and bottom edges; I wanted to do a bit of a crazy shape to show off ‘Wild Betty’, while still representing Noosa - hence the waves. The neck label is a simple rectangular shape with rounded corners. For the embellishment, I decided to incorporate a spot UV over the black outlines of the hat and dolphin, the dolphin’s eyes, and the pink parts of the flowers. I wanted the dolphin and supporting graphics to really stand out on the label, and because spot UV works well on black, I decided to mostly use it on the outlines.</p> <br>
            <p>I had a lot of fun creating this label and believe that others will find it interesting and humorous. The main hope was that it would become a talking point amongst friends and groups of people.</p>
